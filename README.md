# Train a custom object detection model with TensorFlow Lite Model Maker

In this colab notebook, we use the TensorFlow Lite Model Maker to train a custom object detection model and use it on Rapberry Pi.
We use exsisting trained model to train our model with our custom dataset. This method is called  *transfer learning*. Retraining a exsisting model with your own custom dataset reduces the amount of training data and will shorten the training time.
